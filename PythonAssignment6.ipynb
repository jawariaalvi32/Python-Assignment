    "## Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address, down to small computer programs, such as widgets.\n",
